Hi! I'm Willem, an MSc Candidate in Social Data Science at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. I'm interested in applying data science techniques to better understand how humans behave in an increasingly complex, digital world. In particular, my work focuses how technology shapes economic life.

Previously, I worked at [Picnic Technologies](https://picnic.app/nl/), where I leveraged data analytics to advise large FMCG companies on digital and e-commerce strategy. I received my BSc (*Cum Laude*) in Liberal Arts & Sciences from [Leiden University College The Hague](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/governance-and-global-affairs/leiden-university-college-the-hague), with a major in Governance, Economics, and Development, and a minor in Computer Science which I followed at the [Erasmus School of Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/).
