I'm Willem, an MSc Candidate in **Social Data Science** :chart_with_upwards_trend::computer: at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk), **University of Oxford**. I'm interested in applying data science techniques to better understand how humans behave in an increasingly complex, digital world. 

Previously, I worked at [Picnic Technologies](https://picnic.app/nl/), where I crunched data to advise large FMCG companies on digital and e-commerce strategy. I received my BSc (*Cum Laude*) in Liberal Arts & Sciences from [Leiden University College The Hague](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/governance-and-global-affairs/leiden-university-college-the-hague), with a major in Governance, Economics, and Development, and a minor in Computer Science.
